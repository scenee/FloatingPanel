    /// - Important: The timing of changes to this state differs from the timing of
    /// ``FloatingPanelController/state`` and ``FloatingPanelControllerDelegate/floatingPanelDidChangeState(_:)``.
    /// This state updates slightly later due to differences between UIKit animations and SwiftUI view management.
    ///
    /// This modifier provides two-way communication with the floating panel:
    /// - When the user interacts with the panel, the binding updates to reflect the new state
    /// - When you programmatically change the binding value, the panel changes or animates to the new state
    ///
    /// You can use this binding to:
    /// - Respond to state changes when the user interacts with the panel
    /// - Programmatically control the panel position with SwiftUI animations
    /// - Synchronize the panel state with other parts of your UI
    ///
    /// Example usage:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// struct MainView: View {
    ///     @State private var panelState: FloatingPanelState?
    ///
    ///     var body: some View {
    ///         ZStack {
    ///             Color.orange
    ///                 .ignoresSafeArea()
