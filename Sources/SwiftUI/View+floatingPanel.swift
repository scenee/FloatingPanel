    /// ```swift
    /// ScrollView {
    ///     LazyVStack {
    ///         // Main content
    ///         ForEach(items) { item in

    ///     DetailView()

    /// ```swift
    /// ContentView()
    ///     .floatingPanel { proxy in
    ///         PanelContent()
    ///     }

    ///   - coordinator: A coordinator type that conforms to the ``FloatingPanelCoordinator`` protocol.
    ///     Defaults to ``FloatingPanelDefaultCoordinator``. Use a custom coordinator for advanced control
    ///     over panel behavior and events.
    ///   - action: A closure that is called when events occur in the panel. The event type is defined
    ///     by the coordinator's associated `Event` type. This parameter is ignored if you use the default
    ///     coordinator, which doesn't emit events.
    ///   - content: A closure that returns the content to display in the floating panel.
    ///     This view builder receives a ``FloatingPanelProxy`` instance that you can use to
    ///     interact with the panel, such as tracking scroll views or moving the panel programmatically.
